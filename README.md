# Artificial Intelligence for Games and Simulations

`pip install aigs --upgrade`

In this course we use Python 3.11. Running `pip install aigs --upgrade`
in a clean Python 3.11 virtual environment should install all dependencies.
We are assuming that you have a basic understanding of Python and programming.

## `/labs` (under active development)

`labs/` contains exercises for the course, which you should do.
Being able to do the contents of `labs/` is a prerequisite
for being able making a successful final project.

I recommend cloning this repository, and making a folder `my/`
where you can put your own code (I will be updating this repository).

There are three mandatory projects in this course.
They are all under `/prjs` and are not yet completed.
Won't make much sense to look at them until they are completed,
as major parts will be changed and added.
