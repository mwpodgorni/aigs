# Content Generation Miniproject

In this mini project, you will implement a content generating deep neural network.
I recommend using a variational autoencoder.

## TODO

1. Create a generative model that can generate game levels.
2. Train a model on generated game levels.
3. Test the model on actual game levels.
4. Search for a specific game level in the latent space in any non-gradient based way.

## Deliverables
